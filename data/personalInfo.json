    "My name is Phạm Đoàn Phương Anh, a final-year undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Human-Centered Engineering at Fulbright University Vietnam. I am passionate about the intersection of artificial intelligence, computer vision, and autonomous systems, with both academic and practical experience in these areas. My academic journey has been shaped by hands-on research, including a capstone project on photorealistic simulation for semantic segmentation in autonomous vehicles, under the supervision of Dr. Huỳnh Thế Đăng. I have also gained industry experience through an internship at ForthAI (Singapore), where I contributed to the development of AI agent platforms using advanced frameworks like LangChain and LangGraph. My skill set spans from deep learning model development and robotics to MLOps and cloud deployment, and I am committed to applying these technologies to solve real-world problems and contribute to impactful research."
